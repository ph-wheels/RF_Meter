Suggested method to build the control board

- make choice which prower source option you need
	- via barrel connector J1
	- Battery power
	- Both of the above
- via barrel connector J1 you will need to populate J1, F1, Q1 and switch connected to J3 or jumper J3 pin 2-3
- via Battery power you will need to install charger pcb U1, F2, C3, Q2 and switch connected to J3, the BMS unit
	can optionally bypassed by two jumpers B+ to P+ and B- to P-, the battery consist out of 2x L-ion type 18650
	in series which can be mounted on the battery board connected to the control board with 3 lead cable.
- If both than obviously you need to install both options
The inductors L1 and L2 are also optionally components, board space is provide for additional filtering if needed
else one can use some jumper wire.
Please holdoff populating the U4/U5 regulator, the MCU chip and the 0 Ohm resistors, in case of U4 usage omit C11
Next to solder are all the smd components, normal type 0803 resistors and standard caps either 100nF and 10 uF
Next to solder are the push buttons, headers, flatcable connector.
Probably good time now to clean the solder flux and inspect your solder work
Next to solder would be U4 or U5 (BUT U4 regulator has proven to work fine and if less costly then U5)
Time to inspect you work again and apply either battery power or via barrel jack
	Check voltage at J3 pin 3 to be around 7 to 9 Volt (max) or J3 pin 1 to be aroun 6.5 to 8.4 voltage
	Check voltage at J6 pin 7 or 11 to be same as your voltage source.
	No smoke yet ? then proceed to jumper J3 to either 1 - 2 or 2 - 3 and observe voltage at junction R8 - C12
	this should be 3.3 Volt +/- 100mV
If all is well then remove power and insert R8 (0 Ohm resistor) then re-apply power measure 
	pin 2 of MCU to be 3.3 Volt
	Pin 1 U2 to be 3.3 Volt
JP1 should normally be left open and JP2 depends on used uart adapter if power is needed for it it will need jumper
Time to solder MCU chip and clean pcb afterwards to remove any flux residue.
This should complete thecontrol board build however it would do anything untill firmware has been loaded to it.
which will be explained in 'firmware' under software
