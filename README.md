# RF_Meter
dual channel rf meter (work in progress)

This project started off with a question concerning replacement or source for
suitable detector diodes for the Boonton RF Millivolt meter quite a few months ago.
As a result of that, the idea was born to create a millivolt and/or power meter
using one of the modern ADC chips available today and since that time a few test
drawning and PCB where used in the process to the current V5 of the ADC board.
This project has been a combined effort with Jacques (ve2azx, http://www.ve2azx.net),
who had already developped a replacement board for the Boonton series of millivolt/
power meter as to fixed the issue with the mechanical chopper, without his valued
contribution and experiance this project would never exist.

The current design is based to 2 main PCB's and a battery board which also provides
some sheilding to ADC board when mounted on top off it.
