  The RF Meter has an serial port interface which we already used for initial load of the flash memory
  and how to use / setup the needed terminal emulator program can be found in fash_load.txt but
  in general it's a 9600Baud, 8 bit, no parity, 1 stop bit uart setup.
  
  The serial menu will not send out any info unless it receives a serial command string (1-3 characters)
  followed by space and parameter(s), this format may vary for each command, see overview below.
  
  Valid (uppercase only) commands & parameters are:
    A           Continuous ADC conversion
    A0 X y z    dBm Offset for A[0], X = A, B or C, y = range (1-3), z = value 
    C X         Channel select where X = A, B or C
    D x         Debug ADC printout, x = interval (1 - 49), to stop use x = 0
    G x         Gain, where x = gain (1 - 8)
    LP          Load Polynomial data to NVS storage
    LS          Load Vref, Vbat, Sample Rate, # Samples & SPS delay data to NVS storage
    AV x        # of samples used for Zero Offset
    M           single ADC conversion
    MD          single dBm conversion
    MV          single Vac conversion
    NF x        Noise Floor value, where x is range (0 (Off) < 200)  default = 30 //(700 = -60 dBm)
    PS x y      x = ADC Vref value (default = 3.6V), y = Battery voltage
    R x         range, where x = range (1 - 3)
    RO          Auto Range on
    RST         Resetting to factory, will need recal & reload of flash
    U x         Display units, default 0, 0 = dBm, 1 = mW, (2 = uV --> under construction !)
    V x         View Flash value's: 0 - system, 1 - A[0] correction, 2 - menu, 3 - calibration reg's, 4 - sps delays
    
    Note: range 3 = -55 to -25 dBm, range 2 = -25 to -5 dBm, range 1 = -5 dBm to +23 dBm
          the M. MD and MV command's are intended to be used with an external application 
          Once the instrument is completed an the actual battery and ADC 3V6 voltage are known then the PS command
          needs to be executed to make an final correction for battery status display and Vref calibration of the ADC chip
          
          Once the above calibration has been done it may be needed to make a small correction for a channel and a range, this
          can be done with the A0 command like A0 A 2 -0.234e-4 which will add an extra correction for that range while the
          command A0 A 2 0 will remove the extra correction, the actual values and corrections can be displayed by V 1 command.
