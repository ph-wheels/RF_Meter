In order to be able to load the flash content we need:

- Terminal emulation application, I used RealTerm for this as it's able to sent command's and upload a file
- The flash content file in "JSON" format which is provide in this folder named "Corr-rf_mtr.json"
- Operational Control board and firmware successfully loaded and running with USB serial adaptor connected to PC

Download and install the RealTerm from this source (https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/), yes it's an
fairly old program but still does the job at hand nicely.

Start the RealTerm terminal emulator program and make following changes:
- Select 'Port' tab and select the proper serial port (\Serialx) for your USB adapter from drop down
- Set communication speed to 9600 Baud, No Parity, 8 Bits, 1 Stop, No Flow Control
- Click on the 'Open' button and then click on it again, notice port settings in right bottom corner to be active

- Now change to the 'Send' tab and enter LP into first row text box, LS into second row text box
- check mark +CR / +LF on both lines
- On the 'Dump to ...' line click on the '...' button and browse to Corr-rf_mtr.json file

Now you are ready to execute the actual uploads (one for Polynomial, one for reference data) to the RF_Meter by
- click on 'as ASCII' button on first line and the RF_Meter should respond with a message notifing it's ready to
  recieve data within 10 second.
- click on 'Send file' button to start the actual upload of the json file, should take a very short time
- click on 'as ASCII' button on second line and the RF_Meter should respond with a message notifing it's ready to
  recieve data within 10 second.
- click on 'Send file' button to start the actual upload of the json file, should take a very short time

This concludes the software initalization for the flash memory of the RF Meter and next startup should have fixed
the Flash invalid messages.
