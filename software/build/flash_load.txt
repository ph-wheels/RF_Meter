In order to be able to load the flash content we need:
- Terminal emulation application, I used RealTerm for this as it's able to sent command's and upload a file
- The flash content file in "JSON" format which is provide in this folder named "Corr-rf_mtr.json"
- Operational Control board and firmware successfully loaded and running with USB serial adaptor connected to PC

Download and install the RealTerm from this source (https://sourceforge.net/projects/realterm/), yes it's an
fairly old program but still does the job at hand nicely.

Start the RealTerm terminal emulator program and make following changes:
- Select port tab and select the proper serial port (\Serialx) from drop down
- Set communication speed to 9600 Baud, No Parity, 8 Bits, 1 Stop, No Flow Control
- Click on the open button and then click on it again, notice port settings in right bottom corner to be active

- Now change to the send tab, => to be continued ....
